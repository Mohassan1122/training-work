                <p>
                    <p>Motivation has been identified as a useful tool for enhancing productivity. This study aims at
                        determining
                        the impact of motivation on productivity of craftsmen in construction firms in Lagos, Nigeria.
                        Sixteen
                        motivating factors were identified through literature review common to Nigeria construction
                        climate
                        which
                        were used to design questionnaire for the study. A total of 295 questionnaires were administered
                        with
                        150
                        filled and returned. This constitute response rate of 50.85%. Productivity rating was done by
                        work
                        study.
                        The mean of motivating factors was correlated with percentage productive hour observed in the
                        sixteen
                        sites
                        surveyed. The outcome indicates that there is positive linear relationship between motivation
                        and
                        productivity. Therefore, motivation influences craftsmen performance in Nigeria construction
                        industry.</p>

                    <p>urther analysis also shows that craftsmen are basically motivated by financial incentives. The
                        papeFr
                        recommends that financial incentive should be considered for craftsmen in the industry.
                        Moreover,
                        alternative method to working overtime should be employed. The paper concluded that motivation
                        strategy
                        that
                        will enhance productivity should be adopted for workers in the industry.
